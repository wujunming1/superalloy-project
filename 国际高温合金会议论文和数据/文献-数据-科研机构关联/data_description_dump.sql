Predicted porosity volume fraction is up to 12% of the single track when 5 statistical powder distributions are simulated for each powder layer thickness. Processing-induced microstructure is predicted by linking cellular automatons – finite element calculations indicate further that the cooling rate is about 4400 oC/s and grain growth strongly follows the thermal gradient giving rise to a columnar grain morphology if homogeneous nucleation is assumed.

Buchmann', '2016-12-15', 'AD730TM;U720Li;Ingot size;Microstructure;Mechanical properties ', 'The enhancement of efficiency in gas turbine engines requires the development of new superalloys capable of withstanding higher temperatures. The development of new industrial cast and wrought (C&W) disk alloys with required combination of strength, creep and fatigue properties at 700 °C is highly desired due to expensive cost of powder metallurgy. The development of U720Li in the nineties provided an intermediate solution in term of cost / properties combination between 718 and powder metallurgy superalloys. However, U720Li is known to be difficult to be manufactured due to its high γ\' content (45%) and can be considered as the limit between C&W route and powder metallurgy route. Because of this and its intrinsic raw material content, U720Li is significantly more expensive than alloy IN718.  To remain competitive on worldwide aeronautical market, engine designers are more and more challenged to optimize cost/properties combination of each component. In this context, Aubert&Duval has developed a new C&W superalloy, AD730TM, which was designed to offer a better combination between high temperature properties at 700 °C and cost compared to U720Li. The lower content of Ti and the lower γ\' amount in AD730TM compared to U720Li is expected to reduce the segregation tendency. Contrary to U720Li, the better ability of AD730TM for C&W route enables the vacuum arc remelting of larger ingots up to 635 mm diameter, which is expected to have a beneficial impact on billet cost. This paper describes the work performed within the European Cleansky project CESAME (Cost Effective Superalloy for Advanced Modern Engine) which evaluated the feasibility of larger AD730TM ingots (635 mm diameter ingots) in order to improve AD730TM manufacturing cost. Comparisons between AD730TM ingot of 635 mm diameter (called in the following text AD730TM large ingot), AD730TM ingot of 508 mm diameter (called in the following text AD730TM small ingot) and U720Li ingot of 508 mm diameter (called in the following text U720Li ingot) were performed after conversion to billets of 254 mm but also on close-die forged disks. Results on billets showed that increasing ingot size for AD730TM alloy had a beneficial impact on billet microstructure and ultrasonic testing results in comparison with AD730TM and U720Li smaller ingots (508 mm diameter). Increasing AD730TM ingot diameter up to 635 mm was not harmful on chemical homogeneity but led as expected to an increase of carbonitrides size. Tensile, creep and fatigue tests on close-die forged disks showed no detrimental influence of AD730TM larger ingot size (635 mm diameter) compared to AD730TM smaller ingot (508 mm diameter). However, homogeneous microstructure and better UT detectability than those on U720Li disks were obtained on AD730TM disks. Mechanical properties of AD730TM and U720Li are very similar with advantages on tensile strength at high temperature and creep  elongation for AD730TM. Finally, fatigue tests on close-die forged disks showed that the largest carbonitrides observed on disk from AD730TM large ingot did not lead to detrimental effect on fatigue properties.

These compressive stresses are engineered into components to delay initiation of surface cracks and retard crack growth rate thereby improving fatigue life.  In addition, the plastic deformation resulting from the shot peening process hardens the material increasing the yield strength and elastic stress range.  For elastic material response, accurate fatigue life estimates that include credit for residual stresses are possible for complex geometries with complicated load histories.  However, when a shot peened component is subjected to elevated temperatures or cyclic loading, thermal relaxation and cyclic plasticity, respectively, produce inelastic material response from which residual stresses may change continuously.  When the material response is inelastic, taking full credit for compressive residual stresses in fatigue models would result in a nonconservative prediction.  As a result, designers are reluctant to incorporate any compressive residual stresses into fatigue life predictions of turbine engine components, subject to elevated temperatures and inelastic loading conditions.  This paper investigates relaxation of shot peened residual stresses in IN100 when subjected to applied stress profiles that produce large plastic strains and strain gradients in laboratory test samples. Model predictions supported by experiments results are presented to explain that redistribution of residual stress depth profiles are a function of geometry and applied stress/strain profile', 'C', '1Materials and Manufacturing Directorate Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL/RXCM) Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7817 2University of Dayton Research Institute', '0', '0', '', '', '', 'D:\\\\superlloy\\\\literature\\\\piki\\\\Effect of Large Plastic Strains and Strain Gradien.pdf', '0', '0', '191');

In this study, fatigue crack initiation and propagation in coarse grained (CG) and fine grained (FG) Low Solvus, High Refractory (LSHR) alloy developed for disk applications have been assessed at 650 and 725 oC by carrying out three-point bend tests in air and vacuum under a 1-1-1-1 trapezoidal waveform in combination with a surface replication procedure. Optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, focussed ion beam (FIB), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy have been employed to reveal the underlying mechanisms of fatigue crack initiation and early propagation under these fatigueoxidation conditions. The results show that FG LSHR possesses a better fatigue life although it exhibits more severe grain boundary oxidation as indicated by more intergranular fracture surfaces. Cracks mainly initiate from bulged grain boundary oxides which consist of outermost Co-rich and Ni-rich oxide complex at the surface and underneath Cr/Ti/Al oxide intrusions along the grain boundaries. Once initiated, cracks propagate mostly by the coalescence of neighboring grain boundary cracks as observed on the replicas, especially in the FG variant.

The current investigation aims to further understand the effects of synthetic sea salt deposition on the oxidation behavior of a secondgeneration nickel-base single-crystal superalloy CMSX-4. A series of isothermal and cyclic oxidation tests at 1100 °C were carried out on bare and salt-deposited samples. The effects of different salts and altered salt application regimes on cyclic oxidation at 1100 °C were also evaluated. Further experiments were carried out using thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) to study the cyclic oxidation process in greater detail for both the bare and sea salt-deposited samples. During both isothermal and cyclic oxidation, synthetic sea salt deposition generally resulted in enhanced oxidation attack compared to the bare sample. Prior oxidation to produce a stable coherent protective alumina coating loses its protective capability as soon as salt is added. Conversely, after being subjected to cyclic oxidation with salt deposition, poorer oxidation resistance was noted in subsequent cyclic oxidation without salt deposition. Cyclic oxidation investigated with TGA shows that with salt deposition, significant oxidation attack occurs within the first few cycles, after which a steady-state oxide regeneration and spallation regime was progressively attained.

This alloy has also been considered for high temperature fastener applications thanks to its high mechanical properties up to 750 °C and its good workability. In this study bars with diameters in the 1527mm diameter range were successfully hot rolled to enable the evaluation of AD730TM for fastener applications.

Heat-treatment of AD730TM was investigated and optimized for fasteners applications against notch sensitivity and balanced tensile, creep and fatigue properties. Results show that creep notch sensitivity can be mitigated by increasing the aging temperature, decreasing the cooling rate after solution heat-treatment or decreasing the solution heat-treatment temperature.

The authors found a characteristic pattern, called the EBSD striation, on the cross section of a serviced gas turbine bucket which had low cycle fatigue cracks. The EBSD striation seems to indicate a fatigue crack growth rate similar to the striation observed in the fatigue fracture surface of ductile materials. In this paper, in order to assess the accuracy of the low cycle fatigue crack growth rate, investigations into the cross sectional EBSD analyses of fatigue crack growth specimens made of a directionally solidified or a single crystal Ni-based superalloy were carried out. As a result of the detailed EBSD observation, striation patterns corresponding to the crack growth rate were found in the crosssection of the fatigue fracture specimen, even if the fracture surface did not have any striation patterns. Furthermore, with a sufficiently small step size for the EBSD striation spacing, it was possible to properly evaluate the crack growth rate.

SEBM offers a great potential to process high performance alloys like intermetallics, e.g. TiAl or FeAl, and Ni-based superalloys, which are hard or non weldable materials with high susceptibility to crack-formation. Especially the high process temperatures during SEBM are beneficial for reducing stresses and warpage. In addition, SEBM works under vacuum  which  guarantees  a  perfect  protection  against contamination. In this contribution, SEBM of the single crystalline nickel-base superalloy CMSX-4 ®1 is investigated. It is shown that crack formation can be avoided by appropriate processing conditions. Regarding the microstructure, SEBM opens the possibility to tailor the microstructure. Whether a columnar grained or a single crystalline grain microstructure is produced depends on the process strategy used. For the first time it is shown, that it is even possible to produce a single crystalline material by an additive powder bed manufacturing process without any grain selector or a seed crystal. The inherent high cooling rates during SEBM lead to a strong reduction of the length scale of the well-known strong segregations in CMSX-4 ® to some microns. Therefore, long-time and expensive heat treatments are reduced to minutes for a complete homogenization of the single crystal specimen, even for Re.

In the current study performed on the Low Solvus High Refractory (LSHR) disk alloy, the influence of these two mechanisms were separated so that the effects of each could be quantified and modeled. Seven different microstructural variations of LSHR were produced by controlling the cooling rate and the subsequent aging and thermal exposure heat treatments. Through cyclic fatigue crack growth testing performed both in air and vacuum, it was established that four out of the seven LSHR heat treatments evaluated, possessed similar intrinsic environmental resistance to cyclic crack growth. For these four heat treatments, it was further shown that the large differences in dwell crack growth behavior which still persisted, were related to their measured stress relaxation behavior. The apparent differences in their dwell crack growth resistance were attributed to the inability of the standard linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) stress intensity parameter to account for visco- plastic behavior. Crack tip stress relaxation controls the magnitude of the remaining local tensile stresses which are directly related to the measured dwell crack growth rates. It was hypothesized that the environmentally weakened grain boundary crack tip regions fail during the dwells when their strength is exceeded by the remaining local crack tip tensile stresses. It was shown that the classical creep crack growth mechanisms such as grain boundary sliding did not contribute to crack growth, but the local visco-plastic behavior still plays a very significant role by determining the crack tip tensile stress field which controls the dwell crack growth behavior. To account for the influence of the visco-plastic behavior on the crack tip stress field, an empirical modification to the LEFM stress intensity parameter, Kmax, was developed by incorporating into the formulation the remaining stress level concept as measured by simple stress relaxation tests.

As the magnitude of stored strain energy increased to promote strain-induced boundary migration (SIBM) and the formation of Σ3 boundaries during annealing, this led to an overall decrease in the density and fraction of pre-existing twin boundaries in the as-deformed microstructure. Consequently, subsequent annealing only resulted in minor changes in the Σ3 density and fraction as a function of the deformation parameters. The larger starting grain size in RR1000 was less conducive to the formation of Σ3 boundaries as strain incompatibilities and twin reorientations occurred when dislocation plasticity mechanisms were operative.

Liquidus and solidus temperatures are hardly inﬂuenced by the Ni/Co content, but the γ solvus temperature is strongly decreasing with increasing Co content. Addition of Cr to the alloy series lowers liquidus and solidus, but does not inﬂuence the solvus temperature substantially. Neutron diﬀraction experiments conducted on the Cr containing alloys show that the misﬁt is negative for alloys rich in Ni, but linearly increases to positive values with increasing Co content. 3D atom probe tomography shows that W preferentially partitions to the γ phase for the Ni-base alloys, whereas it is enriched in γ for the Co-base alloys. The partitioning of Co (γ), Cr (γ) and Al ( γ) to their respective phases is much more pronounced in Ni rich alloys, i.e. all elements distribute more equally in the Co-base alloys.
